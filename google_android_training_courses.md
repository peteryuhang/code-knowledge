## Android Basics with Compose

### Introduction to programming in Kotlin

- Variable initial value:

```kt
// val name: data_type = initial_value
val count: Int = 2
```

- Type inference(The Kotlin compiler looks at the data type of the initial value, and assumes that you want the variable to hold data of that type):
  - If initial value not been given, type must been specified

```kt
// val name = initial_value
val count = 2
```

- `val` keyword define a variable that is read-only
- `var` keyword define a variable is mutable or changeable
- Use `+` to concatenate strings together, `Int` and `Boolean` can also been concatenated to string in this way
